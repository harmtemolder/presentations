I don't really live anywhere right now. No, really. I housesit for friends, friends of friends and strangers too. Feeding cats and watering plants in exchange for a roof over my head.

# Wait...

Wait, do you see what happened here? I asked the question "Who am I?", but started listing things I **did** or **people I know**. Somehow that always happens when people introduce themselves? But why? I don't really have an answer for you. I guess "knowing thyself" is easier said than done.

I'm supposed to be an architect, one of the analyst types.

I'm quite introverted ("INTROVERTED"), but the traits that those who know me will recognise are the fact that I'm rational to the extreme ("THINKING"), which is not always a good thing. And where others might take their time gathering information before making decisions, I can be quick to decide ("JUDGING"), ready to start doing things instead of talking about them.

OK, that's what tests say I am. But there are plenty of tests I haven't taken yet, so who knows who else I can be

# So what brings me here, tonight?
???

Although leaving everything behind and driving off into the wilderness doesn't necessarily give me any authority to tell you how to live your life, I'd still like to share what I've learned along the way.
---

???

Not just about how to ride a classic motorbike through dry riverbeds, but also about life, the universe and everything.
---

???

About myself and about humans in general
---

# What did I learn, you ask?
---

# Let's start with the foundation:
---

# **Free will**
???

I've always had the conviction that we control our lives

Not necessarily that we have complete free will, but that we do have a choice
---

background-image: url({{ site.baseurl }}/images/free-will.png)
background-size: auto
???

Then I read "Free Will" by Sam Harris

Banks and Isham experimented by delaying feedback on actions
---

template:title-white

background-image: url({{ site.baseurl }}/images/clock.gif)
background-size: auto
???

They set up a computer screen with a clock that would complete two revolutions in 5.2 seconds

And a button inside a box that participants were asked to press at any moment within the second revolution of the clock.

A beep sounded at 5, 20, 40 or 60 ms after the button was pressed.

Electrodes registered the actual neural signal to press the button.

And they asked participants to point to the time on the clock when they decided to press the button.
---

template: list-dark

# So now they have four moments in time measured:
--

## The time the electrodes registered a signal
--

## The time the button was pressed
--

## The time the beep sounded
--

## The time the participants reported they pressed the button
???

What Banks and Isham found was that when they increased the beep delay, the difference between participants' reported button press time and actual button press time increased. For the 20, 40 and 60 ms delays, the reported button press time actually came after the electrode signal.
---

template: title-dark

# Ergo, free will?
???

This suggests that your judgment of when you made a decision is a retrospective estimate and is not based on an actual awareness of the neural activity that causes the movement. And it's one of many experiments trying to address the concept of free will.
---

# Think of a city
???

Think of a city, any city in the world. Why did you name this city? What other cities went through your head? Why only these, even though you probably know the names of hundreds of cities? So picking one out of this set might have been a conscious decision, but the fact that your mind didn't even give you the option of the other ones you know wasn't. Ergo, no free will there.

And the interesting thing is that most of the time, most people don't even make the choice between the set in their minds consciously.
---

# We could be fatalistic about this...
???

... but we could also accept that we're being steered and go with it. Know that your thoughts and feelings are just chemical processes and make the best of it.
---

# One example
---

![](picture of me offroading)
???

During our trip, I would get exhausted. Riding a motorbike offroad is tiring. And I can be stubborn. I don't like giving in to my body. So I used to stretch the time between stops longer than was good for me.
---

![](snickers)
???

That made me cranky. Hangry. I didn't like this and Loes even less so. So to restore from this blood sugar dip, because that's what it was, I'd eat cookies. And I'd be fine again. Until it happened again. And again. And again.
---

???

So in March last year, when we returned to Kyrgyzstan, I decided to stop eating sugar. I figured that if I cut away the sugar highs, there would be no more sugar lows either.
---

![](that sugar film)
???

And then I dove into this further. And decided that food does things to humans, because humans are just bags of water run by chemical processes...
---

# Food feeds your chemical processes
---

# Eat right, right?
???

Well, what is "right"? Since that's mostly based on opinions, and I don't value opinions (remember the architect's traits?), I've started experimenting with what food works for me.
---

# `fruit == sugar?`
---

# `carbs == sugar?`
---

background-image: url({{ site.baseurl }}/images/whole30.png)
background-size: cover
???

In January I started eating whole foods only. Fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, eggs and nuts. So no processed foods, grains, dairy or anything else that is known to have a negative effect on some humans.
---

# 30 days of "detox"
???

Then, after 30 days of detox, I experimented with each of the foods I didn't eat to see what they do to me
---

![](cheese)
???

I like strong cheese, the older the better, but I now know that I shouldn't eat it when I need energy after. All of my energy is needed to metabolize it
---

![](lasagna)
???

I also know that grains, especially bread and pasta, have an effect on me similar to eating sugar: first a peak, then a dip
---

![](carbs, fat, protein)
???

As a result, I'm now eating more fat and less carbs and I'm feeling better than ever
---

![](Strava)
???

I save carbs for when my body actually needs fast energy, for example when cycling for more than an hour. There's this Dutch book on food at the top of my reading list. I haven't read it yet,  but that shouldn't stop you from reading it. It's called...

"So how do I start meditating?", you ask?

Just do it. That's really all there is to it. Pick an app, or try them all, they all have free trials. Pick a time. For me, first thing in the morning works to set the mood for the rest of the day. I have found that meditating at the end of the afternoon can be more intense, since I'm fully awake and a mind full of thoughts to be aware of. And to give you a taste of what meditating is like, I'd like to give the word to Sam Harris

# Sleep

Sleep
---

# Stage 1
???

Stage 1 is the transition phase, where you claim you weren't sleeping if you're awakened. This is also the phase where you might feel like you're falling.
---

# Stage 2
???

In stage 2, your heart rate and body temperature drop.
---

# Stage 3
???

Stage 3, or...
---

# Deep sleep
???

... deep sleep, where you won't be easily woken up.
---

# REM
???

And then there's REM, or...
---

# Rapid Eye Movement
???

... Rapid Eye Movement. Your brain becomes active again, while your body becomes immobilised. This is where you dream.
---

# ~90 minutes

???
Together, these sleep stages last about 90 minutes for the first cycle and a bit longer for the next ones.
---

# Usually 4 to 5 cycles

Usually 4 to 5 cycles per night

# Stage 1

# 5:45 - 6:45
???

My alarm rings between 5:45 and 6:45, depending on when I sleep lightest
---

# 22:00
???

So, taking the time needed to fall asleep into account, my bedtime is around 10 o'clock for 5 cycles. Aside from getting enough sleep, another important factor to improve your sleep is...
---

# Consistency
???

... consistency. Your body has a rhytm and by sleeping in on the weekends, you mess this rhytm up. Trust me, and leave your alarm on on Saturday morning.
---

# `3 > 3.5`
???

And if you're out late on Friday, you might actually feel more refreshed if you complete 3 cycles, than if you set your alarm 1 hour later. Or if you're awake in the morning and see that you have half an hour left until your alarm goes, just get up. You'll thank yourself for it.

The Sleep app has millions of users, and about one hundred thousand of those opted in to have their sleep data analysed. This graph shows the rating users give their sleep as a result of where in the 30 minute default smart period they were woken up. The yellow dot at 1.0 is the point here: if the smart period ends and you weren't ready to be woken yet, because you were in deep sleep, for example, you wake up less happy.

# End with Why

We've talked about things you can do to improve your life, but not about why you should. Now, goals are personal. All of you probably want something completely different from what I want, or from what the person next to you wants. But to get somewhere, you need to know where you want to get to.
