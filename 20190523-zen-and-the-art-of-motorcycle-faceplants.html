I don't really live anywhere right now.

# I have two brothers
???

and together with a cousin us four are the last of the male Te Molder line
---

# And I shouldn't forget Loes
???

I have a girlfriend, Loes, for almost ten years already
---

# Nope, no kids or wedding ring
---

# Studied Leisure Studies
???

I studied Leisure Studies in Tilburg...
---

# And Persuasive Communication
???

...and Persuasive Communication in Amsterdam.
---

# Worked at Expand Online
???

I went off to work at an online marketing agency in Rotterdam

---
# Wait...
???

Wait, do you see what happened here? I asked the question "Who am I?", but started listing things I did or people I know. Somehow that always happens when people introduce themselves? But why?
---

# I have tried figuring out who I am
???

just like you tried figuring out who you are, I presume
---

# Expand Online offered us trainings and personality tests
---

# You might've heard of the **Insights Discovery** test

From these four I'm both blue and red: I'd pick the "deliberate" and "determined" keywords for myself

So when you split the four types to eight, that makes me a reformer: "determination, monitoring performance, discipline"

Then there is another school of thought that goes even more granular: 16 personality types

I'm supposed to be an architect, one of the analyst types.

I'm quite introverted ("INTROVERTED"), but the traits that those who know me will recognise are the fact that I'm rational to the extreme ("THINKING"), which is not always a good thing. And where others might take their time gathering information before making decisions, I can be quick to decide ("JUDGING"), ready to start doing things instead of talking about them.

OK, that's what tests say I am. But there are plenty of tests I haven't taken yet, so who knows who else I can be

# Who noticed the segue there?

Let's go back

This one, here. You're not here to hear me talk on and on about personality tests. You're here to hear about what I did.
