I don't really live anywhere right now.
---

I have two brothers
???

and together with a cousin us four are the last of the male Te Molder line
---

Leisure Studies
???

I studied Leisure Studies in Tilburg...
---

Persuasive Communication
???

...and Persuasive Communication in Amsterdam.
---

Expand Online
???

I went off to work at an online marketing agency in Rotterdam
---

Loes
???

I have a girlfriend, Loes, for almost ten years already
---

Nope, no kids or wedding ring
---

???

Do you see what happened here? I asked the question "Who am I?", but started listing things I did. Isn't that what always happens in an introduction? But why does that happen?
---

I have tried figuring out who I am
???

just like you tried figuring out who you are, I presume
---

Working together in teams, my former employer offered trainings and personality tests
---

You might've heard of the Insights Discovery test

From these four I'm both blue and red: I'd pick the "deliberate" and "determined" keywords for myself
---

So when you split the four types to eight, that makes me a reformer: "determination, monitoring performance, discipline"

Then there is another school of thought that goes even more granular: 16 personality types

based on 5 traits:
Mind: I'm 65% introverted
Energy: I'm 52% intuitive
Nature: 86% thinking
Tactics: 90% judging
Identity: 58% assertive
So, in their eyes, that makes me an Assertive Architect.
---

That's who the tests say I am
