I'm quite introverted *(point to "INTROVERTED", the 1st trait)*, but the traits that those who know me will recognise are the fact that I'm rational to the extreme *(point to "THINKING", the 3rd trait)*. And where others might take their time gathering information before making decisions, I can be quick to decide *(point to "JUDGING", the 4th trait)*, ready to start doing things instead of talking about them. As you can imagine these traits can come in handy when working together with others, but they might annoy the shit out of others too. Knowing about these has made me more aware of my behaviour and helps me intervene when needed. This became even more informative when I compared it to...

*Note to self: Drag the map around on the screen, not on the laptop*

From the **Netherlands** we drove through the **Balkans**, spent about a month in **Turkey** and then drove North.

Through **Georgia**, **Russia** and **Kazakhstan** into **Uzbekistan**.

From there into the mountains of **Tajikistan** and **Kyrgyzstan**.

And then it got cold. It was October and in **Kyrgyzstan** the temperature can drop to minus thirty in winter.

So we went on holiday to **Thailand** and **Malaysia**, flying back to **Kyrgyzstan** in March of last year.

Then **Kazakhstan** again, through the **Russian Altai** followed by two months in **Mongolia**.

And then blasting through two thirds of **Russia**, from **Lake Baikal** all the way into **Estonia**.

From there, slowly back to the **Netherlands**.

... a clock that would complete two revolutions in 5.2 seconds

And a button inside a box that participants were asked to press at any moment within the second revolution of the clock.

A beep sounded at 5, 20, 40 or 60 ms **after** the button was pressed.

Electrodes registered the actual neural signal to press the button.

And they asked participants to afterwards point at the time on the clock when they decided to press the button.

What Banks and Isham found was that when they increased the beep delay, the difference between participants' reported button press time and actual button press time increased. For the 20, 40 and 60 ms delays, the reported button press time actually came after the electrode signal.
---

# Ergo, free will?
???

This suggests that your judgment of when you made a decision is a retrospective estimate and is not based on an actual awareness of the neural activity that causes the movement. And this is just one of many experiments trying to address the concept of free will. I'd like to try a simpler thought experiment here. *Point at someone* You, what's your name? Would you do something for me? Nothing weird, don't worry, just...
---

# Think of a city
???

... think of a city, any city in the world.

What city did you choose?

Why this one?

What other cities went through your head?

Why only these, even though you probably know the names of hundreds of cities?

So picking one out of this set might have been a conscious decision, but the fact that your mind didn't even give you the option of the other ones you know wasn't. Do we have complete free will if your mind made an subconscious pre-selection before letting you pick?

And the interesting thing about all this is that most of the time, most people don't even make the choice between the set in their minds consciously.

Just do it. That's really all there is to it. Pick an app, or try them all, they all have free trials. Pick a time. For me, first thing in the morning works to set the mood for the rest of the day. I have found that meditating at the end of the afternoon can be more intense though. Probably since I'm fully awake and have a mind filled with thoughts to be aware of. And to give you a taste of what meditating is like, I'd like to give the word to Sam Harris.

# Stage 1

Stage 1 is the transition phase, where you claim you weren't sleeping if you're awakened. This is also the phase where you might feel like you're falling.

# `3 > 3.5`
???

And if you're out late on Friday, you might actually feel more refreshed if you complete 3 cycles, than if you set your alarm 1 hour later. Or if you're awake in the morning and see that you have half an hour left until your alarm goes, just get up. You'll thank yourself for it.

The Sleep app has millions of users, and about one hundred thousand of those opted in to have their sleep data analysed. This graph shows the rating users give their sleep as a result of where in the 30 minute default smart period they were woken up. The yellow dot at 1.0 is the point here: if the smart period ends and you weren't ready to be woken yet, because you were in deep sleep, for example, you wake up less happy.

# End with Why

We've talked about things you can do to improve your life, but not about why you should. Now, goals are personal. All of you probably want something completely different from what I want, or from what the person next to you wants. But to get somewhere, you need to know where you want to get to.

I'm not even sure if people like this exist, but think of a non-procratinator's brain as being captained by a rational decision maker. Well, procrastinators have that same rational decision maker captaining their ship. The problem is that they're not the only one up there. There also is...
