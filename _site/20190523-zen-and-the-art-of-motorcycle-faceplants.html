I don't really live anywhere right now.

# I have two brothers
???

and together with a cousin us four are the last of the male Te Molder line
---

# And I shouldn't forget Loes
???

I have a girlfriend, Loes, for almost ten years already
---

# Nope, no kids or wedding ring
---

# Studied Leisure Studies
???

I studied Leisure Studies in Tilburg...
---

# And Persuasive Communication
???

...and Persuasive Communication in Amsterdam.
---

# Worked at Expand Online
???

I went off to work at an online marketing agency in Rotterdam

---
# Wait...
???

Wait, do you see what happened here? I asked the question "Who am I?", but started listing things I did or people I know. Somehow that always happens when people introduce themselves? But why?
---

# I have tried figuring out who I am
???

just like you tried figuring out who you are, I presume
---

# Expand Online offered us trainings and personality tests
---

# You might've heard of the **Insights Discovery** test

From these four I'm both blue and red: I'd pick the "deliberate" and "determined" keywords for myself

So when you split the four types to eight, that makes me a reformer: "determination, monitoring performance, discipline"

Then there is another school of thought that goes even more granular: 16 personality types

I'm supposed to be an architect, one of the analyst types.

I'm quite introverted ("INTROVERTED"), but the traits that those who know me will recognise are the fact that I'm rational to the extreme ("THINKING"), which is not always a good thing. And where others might take their time gathering information before making decisions, I can be quick to decide ("JUDGING"), ready to start doing things instead of talking about them.

OK, that's what tests say I am. But there are plenty of tests I haven't taken yet, so who knows who else I can be

# Who noticed the segue there?

This one, here. You're not here to hear me talk on and on about personality tests. You're here to hear about what I did.

# So what brings me here, tonight?
???

Although leaving everything behind and driving off into the wilderness doesn't necessarily give me any authority to tell you how to live your life, I'd still like to share what I've learned along the way.
---

???

Not just about how to ride a classic motorbike through dry riverbeds, but also about life, the universe and everything.
---

???

About myself and about humans in general
---

# What did I learn, you ask?
---

# Let's start with the foundation:
---

# **Free will**
???

I've always had the conviction that we control our lives

Not necessarily that we have complete free will, but that we do have a choice
---

background-image: url(/images/free-will.png)
background-size: auto
???

Then I read "Free Will" by Sam Harris

???

Banks and Isham experimented by delaying feedback on actions
---

template:title-white

background-image: url(/images/clock.gif)
background-size: auto
???

They set up a computer screen with a clock that would complete two revolutions in 5.2 seconds

And a button inside a box that participants were asked to press at any moment within the second revolution of the clock.

A beep sounded at 5, 20, 40 or 60 ms after the button was pressed.

Electrodes registered the actual neural signal to press the button.

And they asked participants to point to the time on the clock when they decided to press the button.
---

template: list-dark

# So now they have four moments in time measured:
--

## The time the electrodes registered a signal
--

## The time the button was pressed
--

## The time the beep sounded
--

## The time the participants reported they pressed the button
???

What Banks and Isham found was that when they increased the beep delay, the difference between participants' reported button press time and actual button press time increased. For the 20, 40 and 60 ms delays, the reported button press time actually came after the electrode signal.
---

# Ergo, free will?
???

This suggests that your judgment of when you made a decision is a retrospective estimate and is not based on an actual awareness of the neural activity that causes the movement. And it's one of many experiments trying to address the concept of free will.
---

# Think of a city
???

Think of a city, any city in the world. Why did you name this city? What other cities went through your head? Why only these, even though you probably know the names of hundreds of cities? So picking one out of this set might have been a conscious decision, but the fact that your mind didn't even give you the option of the other ones you know wasn't. Ergo, no free will there.

And the interesting thing is that most of the time, most people don't even make the choice between the set in their minds consciously.
---

# We could be fatalistic about this...
???

... but we could also accept that we're being steered and go with it. Know that your thoughts and feelings are just chemical processes and make the best of it.
---

# One example
---

![](picture of me offroading)
???

During our trip, I would get exhausted. Riding a motorbike offroad is tiring. And I can be stubborn. I don't like giving in to my body. So I used to stretch the time between stops longer than was good for me.
---

![](snickers)
???

That made me cranky. Hangry. I didn't like this and Loes even less so. So to restore from this blood sugar dip, because that's what it was, I'd eat cookies. And I'd be fine again. Until it happened again. And again. And again.
---

???

So in March last year, when we returned to Kyrgyzstan, I decided to stop eating sugar. I figured that if I cut away the sugar highs, there would be no more sugar lows either.
---

![](that sugar film)
???

And then I dove into this further. And decided that food does things to humans, because humans are just bags of water run by chemical processes...
---

# Food feeds your chemical processes
---

# Eat right, right?
???

Well, what is "right"? Since that's mostly based on opinions, and I don't value opinions (remember the architect's traits?), I've started experimenting with what food works for me.
---

# `fruit == sugar?`
---

# `carbs == sugar?`
---

background-image: url(/images/whole30.png)
background-size: cover
???

In January I started eating whole foods only. Fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, eggs and nuts. So no processed foods, grains, dairy or anything else that is known to have a negative effect on some humans.
---

# 30 days of "detox"
???

Then, after 30 days of detox, I experimented with each of the foods I didn't eat to see what they do to me
---

![](cheese)
???

I like strong cheese, the older the better, but I now know that I shouldn't eat it when I need energy after. All of my energy is needed to metabolize it
---

![](lasagna)
???

I also know that grains, especially bread and pasta, have an effect on me similar to eating sugar: first a peak, then a dip
---

![](carbs, fat, protein)
???

As a result, I'm now eating more fat and less carbs and I'm feeling better than ever
---

![](Strava)
???

I save carbs for when my body actually needs fast energy, for example when cycling for more than an hour
---

# But what works for me doesn't necessarily work for you
???

So experiment on yourself. And if there's one thing you take away from all this, it should be
---

# Stop eating sugar
???

Stop eating sugar, that shit is bad
---

template: title-lightest

# OK, bags of water, chemicals, food, what else?
---


# That leaves one question from me to you:
---

# How are you going to do tomorrow differently from today?
